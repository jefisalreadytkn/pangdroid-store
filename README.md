## `🗣️ What is PangDroid C?`

Built by blackholesuu and sharkyy, PangDroid C is the more sigma community-powered version of PangDroid—made in PenguinMod, held together by code and chaos. It’s weird, kinda works, and might be the next Linux (or not).

No effort? No problem. Boot it up, mess around, and call it productivity. <br><hr><br>
